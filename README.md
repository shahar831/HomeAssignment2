The main goal of the project was to create a website in a better and more professional way than the previous assignment,a nd in addition, to learning new tools and new knowledge with its help.

New things I learned in the current project:
-Use animation and transactions.
-More correct use of flexbox and other relevant learning material.
-How to look at the "full picture" when I manage to write and design a page and how to make a -correct division.
-How to write a basic script.
